Final Project –Network Traffic Analyzer

This main goal of this project is to evaluate your understanding of the scanning and analyzing the network traffic to detect an attack.  

Description:Write an application that can read the network traffic of the NIC on a machine and create the traffic flows and save theflows with five labels and 2-3 proposed features.

Five  Flow  Labels:Source   IP,Destination   IP,Source   Port,Destination   Port,   and Protocol.

Proposed features: Such as number_of_connections_in_1_minute

Instructions:  
1.Select one attack (Such as DDoS attack)
2.For  detecting  your  selected  attack,  find  minimum  2  and  maximum 3 networktraffic features (Such as number_of_connections_in_1_minute)
3.Develop your application for capturing the network traffic and create the network flows. Flows should have 5 labels as explained before.  
4.Calculate your 2-3 proposed features for the network trafficFinal 


Report:
1.The source code.
2.List of proposed features with explanation
3.Sample of the application’s output for minimum 10  minutes’traffic analysis 
4.Presentation file (15 minutes presentation)

Notes: 
•Please follow the timetable and deadline for the final project submission
•Final project is a group project for the undergraduate students and individual for graduate students 
•The application which can detect faster with the least number of features will have the higher mark. 
•Everyone should upload the report and presentation files in “Final Project” folder on D2L (each group member individually copiesthe same group work)
